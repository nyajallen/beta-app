# NEW USERS / EMULATOR USE:
Dependencies and Android Studio must be set up.<br>
This was tested using a Pixel 3a and 3a XL, along with an API 29. <br>
For the first run of the emulator, a location must be set in the emulator to use the emergency button.<br>
This can be done by going to (... -> Location -> Set Location) in the emulators tool bar.<br>
To use the biometric fingerprint login for the child user, the permission must be enabled, and a fingerprint stored.<br>
This can be done by going in the phone to (Settings -> Security -> Fingerprint -> "Choose a backup screen lock method")<br>
To store a fingerprint the user can go to (... -> Fingerprint -> Finger 1) then click "TOUCH THE SENSOR" to simulate a finger press <br>
A screenshot reference can be located at the bottom of the readme to assist you in setting these up.<br>
If you have trouble getting Android Studio running correctly, you may need to configure your SDK correctly,
or import your android project correctly.<br><br>
